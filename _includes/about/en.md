Hey, I am Xu Kehao (@hcidsi), hailing from North China University of Technology, under the mentorship of Professor Wu Yafeng. I am currently in the process of job hunting as a student.

My interests include animations, games <del>(especially JRPGs)</del>, and novels, and I aspire to join the film/animation or game development industry.

At present, I am studying computer graphics, game engine development, and Unity game development. I have a passion for and a deep love for the technology that turns fantasies into reality.
